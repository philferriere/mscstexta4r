* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  API (4:14, 10:10, 14:33, 14:53)
  
Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), we believe this spelling to be correct.

R CMD check tests were run in all test environments listed at the top of this note.

Thank you for your help and patience.
